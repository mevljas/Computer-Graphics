# Computer Graphics
Faculty subject Computer Graphics.
## Content (Syllabus outline)
1. Geometry and geometric methods
(transformations, coordinate systems, quaternions,
Euler angles, distances, standard 3D objects)
2. Graphics pipeline (coordinate systems, perspective
projection, clipping and culling, faces, edges,
vertices, rasterisation)
3. Data models in computer graphics (hierarchies,
tree-like representations, levels of detail)
4. Perception and view theory (depth perception,
basic composition, framing scenes, lenses)
5. Lighting (light sources, basic components of a light
source, basic light source positions, lighting and
mood, …)
6. Rendering (shading, raytracing, radiosity, ...)
7. Graphics languages, libraries and production
environments
8. Introduction to animation (storytelling and planning
scenes, animating objects and figures, …)
9. Special effects and introduction to visualization
(modelling and animation with textures, lens flare,
bump mapping, volumetric fog, projected light and
shadows, …)
### Lab work:
Development and implementation of an interactive
graphic application. An introductory course of OpenGL
programming is given in the first part of the semester,followed by independent student work, culminating
with an oral presentation at the end of the semester.
## Objectives and competences
The objective is to introduce the students of computer
science and informatics to the programming and
algorithmic background of computer graphics and their
training to become proficient developers of graphics
applications.
The students will be developing the following
### competences
- The ability to define, understand and solve creative
professional challenges in computer and
information science.
- The ability of professional communication in the
native language as well as a foreign language.
- The ability of knowledge transfer and writing skills
in the native language as well as a foreign language.
- The ability of teamwork within the professional
environment; management of a small professional
team.
- The ability to transmit knowledge to co-workers in
technology and research groups.
- Practical knowledge and skills of computer
hardware, software and information technology
necessary for successful professional work in
computer and information science.  
The ability to independently perform both less
demanding and complex engineering and organisational
tasks in certain narrow areas and independently solve
specific well-defined tasks in computer and information
science.
## Intended learning outcomes
### Knowledge and understanding
Understanding the algorithmic background of computer
graphics and applications.
### Application
Development of graphics applications, visualisations and
animations.
### Reflection
Concordance of theoretical and practical knowledge in
the field of computer graphics.
### Transferable skills
Development of graphics applications (visualizations) in
various areas of profession.
